<h2>Importance of Pulling</h2>

<p> The biggest horizontal pulling benefits are promoting postural and shoulder health in
     everyday life. Many people experience a forward-rounded shoulder posture from using
     handheld technology or sedentary keyboard-heavy desk jobs. When combined with pec and
     anterior delt stretching, horizontal pulling can go a long way in rebalancing this
     hunch. This isn’t to say that horizontal pulling doesn’t show up elsewhere. Rowing
     itself is an entire sport and can be used as a physique-builder and cardiovascular
      tool all at once. </p>
<p> In addition to barbell bent-over rows, single-arm and cable-based row exercises are
     highly valuable horizontal pull variations. A single-arm dumbbell row or cable row
     allows you to balance strength and coordination from limb to limb while also
     accommodating individual body sizes where many machines may fail. Both single-arm
     dumbbell and cable variations also allow for the high variability of hand-grip
     orientation to bias the specific muscle of interest in the upper back. </p>
<p> Similar to the vertical push, the vertical pull boasts a ton of shoulder health
     benefits. While the vertical push will end in a fully-overhead position, the vertical
     pull starts there. This means that the muscles required to stabilize the shoulder
     and initiate the pulling exercise are in their most compromised position at the start.
     </p>
<p> For overall shoulder health and muscular development, a single-arm cable pulldown is an
     extremely well-rounded exercise. Not only will it allow for unilateral strengthening
     and muscle stimulation, it also allows for individualized set up by manipulating the
     rest of the body around the cable stack. Many machine variations perform this exercise
      from a fixed range of motion, which may not allow for an optimal set up. </p>
