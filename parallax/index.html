    <h1>Welcome to Labadee</h1>

  <div class="all_content content-1">
    <h2>A Touristic Island</h2>
    <p>So where is Labadee, Haiti located? Labadee (French: Labadie) is a port located on 
      the northern coast of Haiti within the arrondissement of Cap-Haïtien in the 
      Norddepartment. It is a private resort leased to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., for 
      the exclusive use of passengers of its three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean 
      International, Celebrity Cruises, and Azamara Club Cruises, until 2050.  
      Royal Caribbean has contributed the largest proportion of tourist revenue to Haiti 
      since 1986, employing 300 locals, allowing another 200 to sell their wares on the 
      premises for a fee and paying the Haitian government $12 USD per tourist.  (Wikipedia)</p>
    <p>The port is completely tourist-oriented, and is guarded by a private security force.
       The site is fenced off from the surrounding area, and passengers are not allowed to
        leave the property. Food available to tourists is brought from the cruise ships.
         A controlled group of Haitian merchants are given sole rights to sell their
          merchandise and establish their businesses in the port area. Although sometimes
           described as an island in advertisements, it is actually a peninsula contiguous
            with the island of Hispaniola. The cruise ship moors to the pier at Labadee
             capable of servicing the Oasis class ships, which was completed in late 2009.
               (Wikipedia)</p>
    <p>Oasis class ships can transport up to 6,000 passengers.  If 4,000 passengers get off
       the ship, that is $48,000 that Royal Caribbean pays the Haitian government.
        In addition, if three ships pull into port a week, that is an excellent income which
         Royal Caribbean is paying Haiti. Most importantly, while I enjoy a holiday with my
          family! Attractions include a Haitian flea market, beaches, water sports, a 
          water-oriented playground, an alpine coaster, and the largest zip-line over 
          water. (Wikipedia).</p>

       Tail Coaster. This gravity-powered two-person coaster is sure to get your heart

    <h1>Amazing Resort</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="all_content content-5">
    <h2>Labadee's Affordable Resort</h2>
    <p>Wow, spending time in a Labadee's resort is truly an amazing experience.
       This is an awesome resort on the hill overlooking Cap Haitien. The view is great
        and the overall quality of the resort is simply excellent. The owners, Brenda and
         Lesley, are super caring, warm and accommodating, willing to do a bit extra to
          make a good stay a great one. This is one of the nicest places that I have
           stayed at and I really recommend it if you visit Cap.</p>
    <p>Labadee's resorts manage the clever trick of being right on the edge of Cap-Haitien and
       so an easy walk into town, and yet a world away at the same time.
        they achieve this through their position on a hillside overlooking the town which have
         the added benefit of great views out over the town to the sea. A variety of rooms
          are available from basic but clean and perfectly adequate to rooms at the front
           of the resort with balconies overlooking the view described above. The hill
            behind the resort which forms part of its grounds has trails and viewpoints
             should you have a little time and energy to spare. Staff are professional
              and helpful at all times...</p>
	 <p>The breakfast was excellent and freshly prepared, consisting of coffee, juice, fresh
     fruit, omelette, and toast. Later, we had their spaghetti, and honestly, it was
      better than any I've had anywhere around the world. So good in fact, we had it
       on our second day. The wait staff was attentive and knew how to do their jobs.</p>
