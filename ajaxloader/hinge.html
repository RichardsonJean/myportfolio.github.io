<p> Hinging is one of the most essential movement patterns for lifting, playing sports, and
    general health outcomes. A hip hinge integrates the posterior chain of muscles to
    produce perhaps one of the strongest and safest positions to produce force. From
    Olympic lifting, deadlifting, or picking up a young family member, the hinge plays a
    pivotal role in spinal safety when bending to perform any task.</p>
 <p> The prime movers of the hinge are the glutes and hamstrings. The full complement of
    back and core muscles also stabilizes the spine throughout the exercise. The latissimus
    dorsi, trapezius, abdominals, forearms, and muscles of the hands all contribute to the
    successful execution of loaded hinging. When performed from the floor as a deadlift, the
    quadriceps also contribute to the initiation of the lift.  </p>
 <p> As a general rule, most people do not need to perform a complete deadlift from the floor
      as a part of their primary hinge training. Unless the deadlift is a part of a
      competitive environment, nearly every variation will suffice. </p>
 <p> There is value in training for the capacity to pick something up off the floor, but the
      dumbbell Romanian deadlift is an enormously beneficial exercise. This exercise trains
       grip strength, unilateral coordination, and core engagement, as well as the prime
        movers of the hinge. It also allows you to customize your end range of motion to
         where your mobility currently allows. </p>
